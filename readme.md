# RKE2 High-Availability Cluster Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Install and configure Proxmox on HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9 servers.
- Create VMs for 3 master nodes, 3 worker nodes, and 1 HAProxy Load Balancer.
- Configure networking (VLANs, bridges, static IPs, etc.) on Proxmox.

## Phase 2: RKE2 Installation & Configuration
- Deploy HAProxy for load balancing the master nodes.
- Install RKE2 on master nodes and set up a high-availability cluster.
- Join worker nodes to the RKE2 cluster.
- Configure Kubernetes RBAC, StorageClass, and Networking (CNI).

## Phase 3: Deploy Rancher for Cluster Management
- Install Rancher on RKE2 for UI-based Kubernetes management.
- Configure certificates, ingress, and authentication for Rancher.

## Phase 4: Observability & Monitoring
- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection.
- Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization.
- Implement Loki for log aggregation and Jaeger/OpenTelemetry for tracing.

## Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline with GitOps
- Install GitLab and Jenkins for CI/CD workflows.
- Deploy ArgoCD or FluxCD for GitOps-based deployment.
- Automate deployments using Helm and Kustomize.

## Phase 6: Service Mesh & Security
- Deploy Istio for service mesh and traffic management.
- Set up Keycloak for authentication and OPA Gatekeeper for policies.
- Install Falco for runtime security and threat detection.

## Phase 7: Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture
- Deploy Kafka as a message broker for real-time event processing.
- Integrate with applications running on the cluster.

## Phase 8: Infrastructure as Code & Automation
- Use Terraform to automate VM and infrastructure provisioning.
- Automate configuration management with Ansible.
- Implement backup and restore solutions with Velero.

## Phase 9: Testing, Optimization, and Future Enhancements
- Perform stress testing, high availability testing, and monitoring.
- Optimize networking, security, and storage.
- Explore multi-cluster management and hybrid cloud integration.
